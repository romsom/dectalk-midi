# dectalk-midi
MIDI frontent and utils for DECtalk speech synthesiser

This is Work-in-Progress at the moment but feel free to look around.

## Requirements
You need python 3 and the mido and python-rtmidi packages as well as a dectalk `say` executable.

## Usage
You can play single phonemes via midi after adjusting the phoneme and midi port in the script like this:

```$ ./midi2dectalk.py | say```
